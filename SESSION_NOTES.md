# Session Notes

## 2025-08-13 Session - Phase 3: Visual Selection Highlighting ✅ COMPLETE

### User Request Summary
- User noted: "the navigation works in Visual Block mode now, but the highlighter doesn't kick in"
- User confirmed to proceed with Phase 3 but requested to stop before implementing 'd' command
- Continue from where previous session left off implementing visual selection highlighting

### What We Accomplished

✅ **Successfully completed Phase 3 (#143) visual selection highlighting**

#### 1. Restored Phase 1 & 2 Implementations
- Linter had reverted some Phase 1 and Phase 2 code during checkout
- Restored missing EnterVisualLineModeCommand and EnterVisualBlockModeCommand exports
- Restored missing VisualLine and VisualBlock mode variants in EditorMode enum
- Updated ExitVisualModeCommand and EnterCommandModeCommand to support all visual modes
- Updated mode_manager.rs to handle transitions between all visual modes properly

#### 2. Extended EditorMode Enum
- Added `VisualLine` variant for line-wise text selection (vim's 'V')
- Added `VisualBlock` variant for block-wise text selection (vim's Ctrl+V) 
- Updated all pattern matching throughout codebase to handle new modes

#### 3. Implemented Comprehensive Visual Selection Logic
- **Updated `is_position_selected()` function** to handle all three visual modes:
  - **Character-wise selection** (`Visual` mode): Existing vim 'v' behavior preserved
  - **Line-wise selection** (`VisualLine` mode): Entire lines selected regardless of column
  - **Block-wise selection** (`VisualBlock` mode): Rectangular regions selected
- Split logic into separate helper functions for each mode type
- Added comprehensive tracing for debugging selection behavior

#### 4. Updated Terminal Renderer
- **Status line display** shows correct mode names:
  - "-- VISUAL --" for character-wise mode (existing)
  - "-- VISUAL LINE --" for line-wise mode (new)
  - "-- VISUAL BLOCK --" for block-wise mode (new)
- **Cursor styling** properly handles new visual modes (all use block cursor)
- Fixed pattern matching exhaustiveness for all editor modes

#### 5. Command Registration  
- Added EnterVisualLineModeCommand and EnterVisualBlockModeCommand to command registry
- All new commands properly registered and functional
- Key bindings working: 'v' (Visual), 'V' (VisualLine), Ctrl+V (VisualBlock)

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- All 334 tests passing without any regressions
- Pre-commit checks pass (formatting, linting, tests)
- No new test failures introduced by highlighting changes

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Minimal, surgical changes** to preserve existing functionality
- **Backward compatible** - existing visual mode unchanged
- **Proper mode transitions** - seamless switching between visual modes
- **vim-accurate behavior** for all three visual mode types

### Key Features Now Available (Phase 3)
- **V** or **Shift+V**: Enter line-wise Visual Line mode (highlights entire lines)
- **Ctrl+V**: Enter block-wise Visual Block mode (highlights rectangular regions)  
- **Visual selection highlighting**: Now works properly for all three modes
- **Status line indicators**: Show correct mode names
- **Mode transitions**: Seamless switching between v ↔ V ↔ Ctrl+V

### Files Modified
1. `src/repl/events/types.rs` - Added VisualLine and VisualBlock to EditorMode enum
2. `src/repl/commands/mode.rs` - Added new command structs and updated existing ones
3. `src/repl/commands/mod.rs` - Registered new commands in registry
4. `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` - Updated status line and cursor styles
5. `src/repl/view_models/mode_manager.rs` - Enhanced mode transition logic  
6. `src/repl/view_models/pane_manager.rs` - Implemented comprehensive visual selection logic

### Branch and Commits

## 2025-08-07 Session - Phase 4: VTE-Based Test Infrastructure

### User Request Summary

- Complete Phase 4 of Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring (GitHub issue #71)
- Build test infrastructure with VTE parser for terminal state reconstruction
- Convert test output from println!/eprintln! to tracing

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. VTE-Based Test Infrastructure ✅

- **Implemented VteRenderStream** with proper VTE parser integration
  - Created `VtePerformer` implementing `vte::Perform` trait
  - Handles ANSI escape sequences (cursor movement, colors, screen control)
  - Uses constants for ANSI sequences with proper naming
  - Dynamic line number width for debug output

- **Created Test Directory Structure**
  - `tests/integration_tests.rs` - Main test runner with tracing subscriber
  - `tests/common/terminal_state.rs` - Terminal state parsing and assertions
  - `tests/common/world.rs` - Cucumber world implementation (no global state)

- **Key Technical Decisions**
  - Used type aliases (`CapturedOutput`, `CursorPosition`) to reduce complexity
  - All test utilities marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` until used
  - Proper async handling with Arc/Mutex for thread safety

#### 2. Tracing Integration ✅

- **Replaced all println!/eprintln! with tracing**
  - Added tracing subscriber in test main with EnvFilter support
  - Debug/trace logging throughout test infrastructure
  - Test-friendly output with `with_test_writer()`
  
- **Usage**: `RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --test integration_tests`

### Important Implementation Details

1. **VTE Parser**: Properly interprets escape sequences including:
   - SGR (colors, bold, reverse)
   - Cursor movement (CUP, CUU, CUD, CUF, CUB)
   - Screen/line clearing (ED, EL)
   - All standard control characters

2. **Dynamic Line Numbers**: Terminal debug output adjusts line number width based on content

3. **Clean Architecture**: No global state, proper dependency injection throughout

### Commits Made

- (Ready to commit VTE test infrastructure implementation)

### Next Steps

- Phase 5: Implement actual integration tests using Cucumber feature files
- Test the tricky cursor positioning and visual selection scenarios

## 2025-08-07 Session - Phase 3 Completion: Clean I/O Abstraction & Mode-Aware Cursor

### User Request Summary

- Complete Phase 3 of Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring
- Extract hardcoded ANSI escape codes to named constants
- Fix visual selection colors for better readability
- Fix off-by-one horizontal scrolling bug with wrapped lines
- Implement proper Vim-style cursor behavior in Normal vs Insert modes

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. ANSI Escape Codes Extraction ✅

- Created `/src/repl/views/ansi_escape_codes.rs` with comprehensive ANSI constants
- Extracted all hardcoded escape sequences to named constants
- Added semantic color aliases (FG_SELECTED, BG_SELECTED, etc.)
- User feedback: "overengineered but good"

#### 2. Visual Selection Colors ✅

- Changed from dark blue/black to lighter blue/white for better visibility
- Updated to use BG_SELECTED and FG_SELECTED constants directly
- User selected BG_256_DEEP_SKY_BLUE for selection background

#### 3. Fixed Off-by-One Horizontal Scrolling Bug ✅

- Issue: Cursor at column 111 (width 112) triggered unwanted scroll before wrapping
- Solution: Allow cursor at content_width position without scrolling
- Immediately wrap to next line when reaching content_width boundary
- User feedback: "high five!!!" when fixed

#### 4. Response Pane Cursor Reset ✅

- Fixed cursor staying at invalid position when response content changed
- Now resets cursor and scroll positions to origin when loading new response
- User feedback: "well done!"

#### 5. Vim Normal Mode Cursor Behavior ✅

- Implemented proper Vim cursor constraints:
  - Normal mode: cursor can only be ON characters (indices 0 to n-1)
  - Insert mode: cursor can be positioned AFTER last character (index n)
- Fixed all movement commands: l, $, G, j, k, h
- Added comments explaining the -1 adjustments as requested

#### 6. Mode-Aware Cursor Positioning (Major Enhancement) ✅

- **Added `editor_mode` to `PaneState`** - each pane now tracks its own mode
- Created `LineEndForAppend` movement direction for 'A' command
- 'A' command now positions cursor AFTER last character for insertion
- Mode transitions automatically adjust cursor position
- Applied mode-aware constraints to all navigation commands

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Mode per Pane**: User correctly suggested making `editor_mode` a property of `PaneState` rather than global, as panes could technically have different modes.

2. **Cursor Position Philosophy**:
   - Normal/Visual modes: cursor is ON characters (like selecting)
   - Insert mode: cursor is BETWEEN characters (insertion point)
   - This matches standard Vim behavior

3. **Automatic Adjustments**: When switching from Insert to Normal mode, cursor automatically pulls back if beyond last character.

### Known Issues

- Ghost cursoring issue has returned and is "pretty heavy" - leaving for future fix
- User will reset session for Phase 4

### Commits Made

1. "fix: Match Vim normal mode cursor behavior at line end"
2. "feat: Implement mode-aware cursor positioning"
3. "fix: Apply mode-aware cursor constraints to j/k/h navigation"

### Next Phase

Moving to Phase 4 of the Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring (new session)

### Important Context for Next Session

- Phase 1 and 2 completed previously
- Phase 3 now complete with all ANSI codes extracted and mode-aware cursoring
- Ghost cursor issue exists but deferred
- Check GitHub issue #74 for Phase 4 requirements

# Session Notes

## 2025-08-04 Session Notes

### User Request Summary

- User reported rendering issues (black screen) and dysfunctional `b` command
- Requested to rollback to clean state and reapply fixes

### Completed Work

✅ **Successfully resolved rendering issues and applied core fixes**

#### 1. Rendering Issue Resolution

- **Problem**: Black screen due to hardcoded `is_ci = true` in terminal renderer
- **Solution**: Reverted to issue #55 commit `daffbf0` which has working terminal rendering
- **Result**: Application now renders properly without CI-mode hacks

#### 2. Issue #62 Core Implementation  

- **Added**: `src/repl/geometry.rs` with Position and Dimensions structs
- **Updated**: `src/repl/mod.rs` to include geometry module
- **Status**: Foundation ready for tuple-to-struct migration
- **Builds**: ✅ Successfully compiles

#### 3. Issue #67 Fix Applied

- **Problem**: Dysfunctional `b` command due to character index calculation bug
- **Fixed**: `find_previous_word_boundary` function in `src/repl/models/display_cache.rs`
- **Improvement**: Better character boundary detection for multi-width characters
- **Status**: ✅ Code compiles, needs testing

#### 4. Critical Bug Fix: Cross-Line Word Navigation

- **Problem**: `b` command stopped at word boundary within display line instead of crossing to previous lines
- **Root Cause**: `find_previous_word_position` used `char_count()` instead of `display_width()` when moving to previous line
- **Impact**: Command would get stuck on wrapped lines with multibyte characters
- **Fixed**: Changed `current_col = prev_line_info.char_count()` to `current_col = prev_line_info.display_width()` in `src/repl/view_models/pane_state.rs:518`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and compiles

#### 5. Discovered: Broader Wrapped Word Navigation Issue

- **Problem**: Word navigation commands (`w`, `b`, `e`) don't handle wrapped words correctly
- **Root Cause**: Word boundary detection operates on individual display lines, doesn't understand logical word continuity
- **Example**: Word "criticality" wrapped as "cri" + "ticality" - `b` command stops at "ticality" instead of jumping to "cri"
- **Impact**: Affects all vim-style word navigation when working with long lines (JSON, code, etc.)
- **Status**: 🔍 Identified, needs dedicated GitHub issue and separate fix

### Current State - Rollback Complete ✅

- **Branch**: feature/clean-rollback-with-position-structs (based on issue #55)
- **App version**: 0.25.1  
- **Rendering**: ✅ Working (no black screen issues)
- **Core structures**: ✅ Position/Dimensions structs available
- **Basic navigation**: ✅ Working
- **Word navigation**: ⚠️  Partially working (has wrapped word issue)

### Rollback Summary

✅ **Successfully resolved the original issues**:

1. **Rendering fixed** - Reverted to issue #55 (working terminal rendering)
2. **Issue #62 core applied** - Position/Dimensions structs ready for migration
3. **Issue #67 partially fixed** - Cross-line movement improved but wrapped word issue discovered

### Next Steps / TODO

- Create GitHub issue for wrapped word navigation problem (`w`/`b`/`e` commands)
- Continue Issue #62 migration if desired (replace remaining tuples with structs)
- Address wrapped word navigation in separate focused effort

## 2025-08-05 Session Notes

### User Request Summary

- Multiple terminal display and cursor positioning issues after ICU word segmentation implementation
- Cursor not visible, wrong positioning, Tab key pane switching not working
- Page scrolling (Ctrl+F) cursor positioning problems

### Completed Work ✅

#### 1. Terminal Size Detection Fix

- **Problem**: Hardcoded terminal size (80x24) instead of detecting actual window size
- **Fix**: Replaced hardcoded values with `crossterm::terminal::size().unwrap_or((80, 24))`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 87, 100

#### 2. Cursor Visibility Fix  

- **Problem**: Cursor not displaying at all - always hidden
- **Root Cause**: `is_display_cursor_visible()` always returned `false` due to status bar display flag misuse
- **Fix**: Changed cursor rendering to show cursor in Normal/Insert/Visual modes, only hide in Command mode
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 608-616

#### 3. Cursor Shape by Mode

- **Problem**: Cursor always showing as I-beam regardless of editor mode
- **Fix**: Implemented mode-based cursor styles:
  - Normal/Visual: `BlinkingBlock`
  - Insert/Command: `BlinkingBar`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 642-648

#### 4. Cursor Position Offset Fix

- **Problem**: Cursor starting at column 1 (where line numbers are) instead of after line numbers
- **Fix**: Added line number width offset: `screen_col = display_cursor.col + line_num_width + 1`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 631, 624

#### 5. Tab Key Pane Switching Fix

- **Problem**: Tab key switched pane state but cursor didn't visually move to response pane
- **Root Cause**: Response pane cursor positioning didn't account for pane offset
- **Fix**: Added response pane offset calculation: `screen_row = display_cursor.row + response_start`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 632-635

#### 6. Page Scrolling Cursor Bounds Fix

- **Problem**: During Ctrl+F scrolling, cursor positioned beyond terminal bounds (row 132+ on 40-row terminal)
- **Fix**: Added cursor bounds clamping to prevent positioning outside visible area
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 643-661

#### 7. Environment Variable Enhancement

- **Added**: `BLUELINE_SHOW_DISP_CURSOR_POS` to control status bar cursor position display
- **Files**: `src/repl/models/status_line.rs` line 72

### Outstanding Issues ❌

#### 1. Page Scrolling Logic (Primary Issue)

- **Problem**: Ctrl+F page scrolling doesn't move cursor through logical buffer properly
- **User Requirement**: Page scrolling should move cursor by character/byte count in logical buffer, not display lines
- **Current State**: Attempted to implement logical buffer-based scrolling but still not working correctly
- **Implementation Started**:
  - Added `next_character_position()` and `previous_character_position()` methods to `BufferContent`
  - Modified `scroll_vertically_by_page()` to use character-count based movement
  - **Files**: `src/repl/models/buffer_model.rs` lines 52-82, `src/repl/view_models/pane_state.rs` lines 331-433

### Next Actions Required

#### Immediate Priority

1. **Debug page scrolling implementation**:
   - Check debug logs for `scroll_vertically_by_page` to see if character movement logic is executing
   - Verify `chars_per_page` calculation is reasonable
   - Test if cursor position updates in status bar during Ctrl+F

2. **Multi-byte character boundary handling**:
   - Ensure cursor doesn't land in middle of multi-byte characters after page scrolling
   - May need additional boundary checking in character navigation methods

3. **Page scrolling refinement**:
   - Fine-tune `chars_per_page` calculation (current: `page_size * content_width`)
   - Consider user's original suggestion about byte-based calculations
   - Handle edge cases (beginning/end of buffer)

#### Testing Strategy

```bash
# Test with debug logging
BLUELINE_LOG_LEVEL=debug BLUELINE_LOG_FILE=debug.log BLUELINE_SHOW_DISP_CURSOR_POS=1 ./target/debug/blueline --verbose

# Check page scrolling logs specifically
grep "scroll_vertically_by_page" debug.log

# Monitor cursor position changes  
grep "render_cursor.*screen_pos" debug.log
```

### Architecture Status

#### ICU Word Segmentation ✅

- ICU integration working properly for Issue #67 (`b` command fix)
- Word boundary caching and multi-byte character support operational
- No regressions in word navigation functionality

#### Terminal Rendering Pipeline ✅

- Fixed all rendering macro issues (`execute_term!`, `safe_flush!`)
- Proper crossterm integration restored
- Cursor positioning calculations working for normal editing

#### Current Page Scrolling Approach

The implemented approach moves cursor character-by-character through the logical buffer:

```rust
// Calculate characters per page
let chars_per_page = (page_size * content_width).saturating_sub(content_width);

// Move cursor by character count
for _ in 0..chars_per_page {
    let next_pos = self.buffer.content().next_character_position(new_cursor);
    // ... handle movement
}
```

This should provide the buffer-level movement requested, but needs debugging to identify why it's not working as expected.
