# Session Notes

## [2025-08-21] Model Consolidation and Phase 1 Completion

### User Request Summary
- Complete Phase 1 of unified Command architecture and close GH #197
- Move data model files to models/ directory for better organization
- Consolidate overlapping types (initially LogicalPosition vs Position, but later decided to keep separate)
- Fix compilation errors and maintain backward compatibility

### What We Accomplished

#### ✅ Phase 1: Unified Command Pattern Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- Successfully implemented unified command system where commands contain both `is_relevant()` and `handle()` methods
- Created `UnifiedCommandRegistry` that processes events by checking each command sequentially  
- Integrated into main event loop with gradual migration strategy via `handle_key_event_with_unified_first()`
- YankSelectionCommand working perfectly in the application

#### ✅ Model Organization Cleanup - COMPLETE
Successfully moved all data model files to `/src/repl/models/` directory:

1. **yank_buffer.rs** → `models/yank_buffer.rs` (Fixed issue #180)
   - Moved YankBuffer, ClipboardYankBuffer, MemoryYankBuffer to models
   - Updated imports throughout codebase

2. **screen_buffer.rs** → `models/screen_buffer.rs` 
   - Completed display infrastructure grouping
   - ScreenBuffer, BufferCell now properly in models

3. **geometry.rs** → `models/geometry.rs`
   - Position, Dimensions types for display coordinates
   - Maintained original `row/col` field naming for compatibility

4. **selection.rs** → `models/selection.rs`
   - Selection type for text selection operations
   - Uses LogicalPosition for text coordinates

5. **NEW: logical_position.rs** → `models/logical_position.rs`
   - Created new file for LogicalPosition, LogicalRange types
   - Moved from events/types.rs to consolidate data models
   - Added backward compatibility re-exports in events/types.rs

#### ✅ Import and Compilation Fixes - COMPLETE
- Updated all geometry imports throughout codebase: `use crate::repl::geometry::` → `use crate::repl::models::geometry::`
- Updated models/mod.rs to export all new types
- Updated view_models/mod.rs and repl/mod.rs for new module structure
- All 467 tests passing successfully
- Clean compilation with no errors or warnings

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Kept LogicalPosition and Position separate** - User decided they are logically different (text coordinates vs display coordinates) and should coexist rather than be consolidated
2. **Maintained backward compatibility** - Re-exported LogicalPosition/LogicalRange from events/types.rs so existing imports continue to work
3. **Used patch version v0.45.2** - This was organizational refactoring, not a new feature

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Unified Command Pattern**: Commands are self-contained with `is_relevant()` check and `handle()` execution
- **Gradual Migration Strategy**: New system integrated alongside old system for feature-by-feature migration
- **Clean Model Organization**: All pure data structures now properly located in models/ directory
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing with LogicalPosition (line/column) for text and Position (row/col) for display

### Temporary Changes
None - all changes are permanent architectural improvements

### Version Information
- **Current Version**: v0.45.2
- **Git Tag**: v0.45.2
- **Commit**: "Consolidate data models into models/ directory"

### Next Steps / TODO
- **Phase 2**: Migrate more commands to unified system
  - Candidates: navigation commands, editing commands, mode commands
  - Use existing YankSelectionCommand as template
  - Continue gradual migration approach

### Architecture Status
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Unified Command Infrastructure - COMPLETE  
- 🔄 **Phase 2**: Migrate Business Logic to Commands - READY TO START
- ⏳ **Phase 3**: Merge PaneManager into ViewModel - PENDING
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Move Event Loop to ViewModel - PENDING  
- ⏳ **Phase 5**: Decouple ViewRenderer - PENDING
- ⏳ **Phase 6**: Dual Event Loops with Ghost Cursor Fix - PENDING

### Notes for Next Session
- Start Phase 2 by selecting commands to migrate to unified system
- YankSelectionCommand is working perfectly as template
- Focus on simple commands first (cursor movement, basic text operations)  
- Use `handle_key_event_with_unified_first()` pattern for gradual migration
- All infrastructure is in place for rapid command migration

## 2025-08-21 Session - Architecture Refactoring Plan for Issue #178

### User Request Summary
- Analyzed GitHub Issue #178: "Refactor: Centralize control into ViewModel"
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan to eliminate layers and centralize business logic
- Designed Command Pattern architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Addressed ghost cursor and flickering issues with dual event loops

### What We Accomplished

✅ **Comprehensive Architecture Analysis**
- Analyzed current AppController (1500+ lines) with excessive business logic
- Identified PaneManager as unnecessary delegation layer
- Found tight coupling between ViewRenderer and ViewModel

✅ **Command Pattern Design**
- Designed self-contained Commands owning their business logic
- Created Service layer for shared functionality (SelectionService, YankService, HttpService)
- Separated semantic Model Events from display-specific Render Events

✅ **Event-Driven Rendering Architecture**
- Designed dual event loops (input and render) for optimal performance
- Created atomic render transactions to eliminate ghost cursors
- Added double buffering with smart diffing for smooth updates

✅ **Complete Implementation Plan**
- Created detailed 6-phase implementation plan
- Estimated 12-18 days total effort across 3 weeks
- Designed incremental approach with independent testing

✅ **GitHub Issue Creation**
- Created 6 implementation issues (#197-#202) for parallel development
- Created meta coordination issue (#203) for tracking
- Each phase has clear tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria

### Architectural Decisions

**Command Pattern with Services**
```rust
trait Command {
    fn handle(&self, context: &mut CommandContext) -> Result<Vec<ModelEvent>>;
}
```
- Commands own business logic (not ViewModel)
- Services provide shared functionality
- Clean separation from rendering concerns

**Event Flow Design**
```
Input Events → Commands → Model Events → Render Events → ViewRenderer
```
- Model Events are semantic (what happened)
- Render Events are display-specific (how to show it)
- No coupling between ViewRenderer and ViewModel

**Ghost Cursor Solution**
```rust
struct RenderTransaction {
    hide_cursor: bool,
    operations: Vec<RenderOperation>,
    show_cursor_at: Option<Position>,
    flush: bool,
}
```
- Atomic rendering prevents ghost cursors
- Double buffering eliminates flickering
- Smart batching optimizes performance

### Files Created
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 6-phase implementation plan
- GitHub Issues #197-#203 - Implementation and coordination issues

### Success Metrics Defined
- AppController: 1500+ lines → ~100 lines
- Commands: Self-contained 50-100 line units
- ViewModel: Pure state management (~400 lines)
- Zero ghost cursors and flickering
- <1ms input response, 60fps rendering

### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1 (#197): Command infrastructure and service layer
- Phases can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Meta issue (#203) provides coordination and progress tracking

## 2025-08-23 Session - Service Layer Implementation for Yank/Paste

### User Request Summary
- Complete TODOs in YankSelectionCommand from Phase 1
- Implement Service Layer (originally part of Phase 1 design)
- Fix Visual Block mode copy/paste functionality
- Maintain clipboard toggle functionality (`:set clipboard on/off`)

### What We Accomplished

✅ **Service Layer Architecture Implementation**
- Created `/src/repl/services/` directory with modular service structure
- Implemented `YankService` wrapping YankBuffer trait implementations
- Updated Command pattern to use `ExecutionContext` with both ViewModel and Services
- Successfully fixed Visual Block mode copy/paste operations

#### Key Components Created:

1. **YankService** (`src/repl/services/yank.rs`)
   - Manages switching between memory and clipboard yank buffers
   - Preserves content when switching modes
   - Provides consistent API for yank/paste operations

2. **ExecutionContext** (`src/repl/view_models/commands/command.rs`)
   - Provides both ViewModel and Services to commands
   - Avoids circular dependencies in architecture

3. **Services Aggregator** (`src/repl/services/mod.rs`)
   - Central struct containing all services
   - Currently contains YankService
   - Extensible for future services

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Removed SelectionService** - User correctly identified it as unnecessary indirection
   - Selection operations remain in ViewModel (UI state management)
   - Services should only exist when they add real value

2. **Service Layer Principles Established**:
   - Services manage their own state and resources
   - Services provide complex business logic
   - Services abstract external resources
   - Avoid creating services that are just delegators

### Bug Fixes Completed

✅ **Visual Block Copy Fix**
- `handle_yank_selection` was using old `view_model.yank_to_buffer_with_type()`
- Fixed to use `services.yank.yank()`

✅ **Visual Block Paste Fix**
- `handle_paste_after` and `handle_paste_at_cursor` were using `view_model.get_yanked_entry()`
- Fixed to use `services.yank.paste()`

### Pull Request Created and Merged
- **PR #204**: Service layer implementation with yank/paste fixes
- Successfully merged into develop branch
- Post-merge workflow completed (branches cleaned up)

### Architecture Status After This Session
- Service Layer pattern successfully integrated into Phase 1 architecture
- Commands now have access to both ViewModel (UI state) and Services (business logic)
- Visual Block mode fully functional with proper yank/paste operations
- Clipboard toggle functionality preserved and working

## 2025-08-17 Session - Complete Visual Mode Features (Issue #147)

### User Request Summary
- User returned and asked to check open issues
- Identified Issue #147 was closed but 'gv' command and Unicode support were not implemented
- Implementing missing features from Phase 7 of visual mode implementation

### What We Accomplished

✅ **Implemented 'gv' Command (Visual Selection Repeat)**
- **Branch**: `feature/complete-visual-mode-features`
- **Implementation**: Added full support for 'gv' command to restore last visual selection
- **Key Components**:
  - Added `RepeatVisualSelectionCommand` that responds to 'v' in GPrefix mode
  - Added tracking of last visual selection (start, end, mode) in PaneState
  - Saving selection state when exiting any visual mode
  - Restoring selection with proper cursor positioning on 'gv'
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Added `last_visual_selection_start/end` and `last_visual_mode` fields to PaneState
  - Created `VisualSelectionRestoreResult` type alias to avoid clippy complexity warnings
  - Proper event flow: Command → Controller → ViewModel → PaneManager → PaneState
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed issue where visual selections were not saved when cut/delete operations cleared them
  - Added `save_last_visual_selection_before_clear()` helper method
  - Now saves selection before clearing in delete operations (x, d commands)
- **Quality**: All 377 unit tests passing, pre-commit checks pass

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Command Layer**: 
   - `RepeatVisualSelectionCommand` in `src/repl/commands/mode.rs`
   - Registered in command registry with proper priority

2. **Event System**:
   - Added `RepeatVisualSelectionRequested` to `CommandEvent` enum
   - Proper event handling in `AppController::handle_repeat_visual_selection()`

3. **State Management**:
   - PaneState tracks last selection in three new fields
   - Selection saved automatically on visual mode exit
   - Restoration includes mode type and cursor position

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Used type alias to satisfy clippy type complexity requirements
   - Clean separation of concerns across layers

### What's Still Pending from Issue #147

❌ **Unicode/Multi-byte Character Support**
- Visual Block selection still uses raw column indices
- No special handling for double-width characters
- Would require display width calculations in selection logic

❌ **Comprehensive Testing**
- No integration tests for 'gv' command yet
- No Unicode character tests for visual modes

❌ **Documentation**
- COMMANDS.md not created/updated
- Visual mode documentation not present

### Flickering Issue Investigation and Fix

**Problem**: User reported flickering when switching to Insert mode for the first time after app startup
- Only happens on the very first Insert mode switch
- Tilde characters and status bar flash briefly
- Subsequent mode switches work cleanly without flickering

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- During `initialize()`, cursor was hidden to prepare for initial render
- First mode switch to Insert required both:
  1. Changing cursor style (block → bar)
  2. Changing cursor visibility (hidden → shown)
- The visibility state change was likely triggering additional rendering operations

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `terminal_renderer.rs` initialization to not hide cursor initially
- Let `render_cursor()` handle visibility consistently
- This ensures mode changes only modify cursor style, not visibility state
- Cursor is temporarily hidden during render operations then restored

**Technical Details**:
- Removed `self.render_stream.hide_cursor()?` from `initialize()` method
- `render_full()` and `render_pane()` temporarily hide cursor during operations
- `render_cursor()` always shows cursor (except in Command mode)
- This eliminates the need for visibility state changes on first mode switch

### Next Steps
- User should test if flickering is resolved with this fix
- Unicode support would require significant changes to use display widths
- Integration tests should be added for 'gv' command
- Consider creating COMMANDS.md documentation

- Restored missing EnterVisualLineModeCommand and EnterVisualBlockModeCommand exports
- Restored missing VisualLine and VisualBlock mode variants in EditorMode enum
- Updated ExitVisualModeCommand and EnterCommandModeCommand to support all visual modes
- Updated mode_manager.rs to handle transitions between all visual modes properly

#### 2. Extended EditorMode Enum
- Added `VisualLine` variant for line-wise text selection (vim's 'V')
- Added `VisualBlock` variant for block-wise text selection (vim's Ctrl+V) 
- Updated all pattern matching throughout codebase to handle new modes

#### 3. Implemented Comprehensive Visual Selection Logic
- **Updated `is_position_selected()` function** to handle all three visual modes:
  - **Character-wise selection** (`Visual` mode): Existing vim 'v' behavior preserved
  - **Line-wise selection** (`VisualLine` mode): Entire lines selected regardless of column
  - **Block-wise selection** (`VisualBlock` mode): Rectangular regions selected
- Split logic into separate helper functions for each mode type
- Added comprehensive tracing for debugging selection behavior

## 2025-08-07 Session - Phase 4: VTE-Based Test Infrastructure

### User Request Summary

- Complete Phase 4 of Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring (GitHub issue #71)
- Build test infrastructure with VTE parser for terminal state reconstruction
- Convert test output from println!/eprintln! to tracing

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. VTE-Based Test Infrastructure ✅

- **Implemented VteRenderStream** with proper VTE parser integration
  - Created `VtePerformer` implementing `vte::Perform` trait
  - Handles ANSI escape sequences (cursor movement, colors, screen control)
  - Uses constants for ANSI sequences with proper naming
  - Dynamic line number width for debug output

- **Created Test Directory Structure**
  - `tests/integration_tests.rs` - Main test runner with tracing subscriber
  - `tests/common/terminal_state.rs` - Terminal state parsing and assertions
  - `tests/common/world.rs` - Cucumber world implementation (no global state)

- **Key Technical Decisions**
  - Used type aliases (`CapturedOutput`, `CursorPosition`) to reduce complexity
  - All test utilities marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` until used
  - Proper async handling with Arc/Mutex for thread safety

#### 2. Tracing Integration ✅

- **Replaced all println!/eprintln! with tracing**
  - Added tracing subscriber in test main with EnvFilter support
  - Debug/trace logging throughout test infrastructure
  - Test-friendly output with `with_test_writer()`
  
- **Usage**: `RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --test integration_tests`

### Important Implementation Details

1. **VTE Parser**: Properly interprets escape sequences including:
   - SGR (colors, bold, reverse)
   - Cursor movement (CUP, CUU, CUD, CUF, CUB)
   - Screen/line clearing (ED, EL)
   - All standard control characters

2. **Dynamic Line Numbers**: Terminal debug output adjusts line number width based on content

3. **Clean Architecture**: No global state, proper dependency injection throughout

### Commits Made

- (Ready to commit VTE test infrastructure implementation)

### Next Steps

- Phase 5: Implement actual integration tests using Cucumber feature files
- Test the tricky cursor positioning and visual selection scenarios

---

## 2025-08-07 Session - Phase 3 Completion: Clean I/O Abstraction & Mode-Aware Cursor

### User Request Summary

- Complete Phase 3 of Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring
- Extract hardcoded ANSI escape codes to named constants
- Fix visual selection colors for better readability
- Fix off-by-one horizontal scrolling bug with wrapped lines
- Implement proper Vim-style cursor behavior in Normal vs Insert modes

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. ANSI Escape Codes Extraction ✅

- Created `/src/repl/views/ansi_escape_codes.rs` with comprehensive ANSI constants
- Extracted all hardcoded escape sequences to named constants
- Added semantic color aliases (FG_SELECTED, BG_SELECTED, etc.)
- User feedback: "overengineered but good"

#### 2. Visual Selection Colors ✅

- Changed from dark blue/black to lighter blue/white for better visibility
- Updated to use BG_SELECTED and FG_SELECTED constants directly
- User selected BG_256_DEEP_SKY_BLUE for selection background

#### 3. Fixed Off-by-One Horizontal Scrolling Bug ✅

- Issue: Cursor at column 111 (width 112) triggered unwanted scroll before wrapping
- Solution: Allow cursor at content_width position without scrolling
- Immediately wrap to next line when reaching content_width boundary
- User feedback: "high five!!!" when fixed

#### 4. Response Pane Cursor Reset ✅

- Fixed cursor staying at invalid position when response content changed
- Now resets cursor and scroll positions to origin when loading new response
- User feedback: "well done!"

#### 5. Vim Normal Mode Cursor Behavior ✅

- Implemented proper Vim cursor constraints:
  - Normal mode: cursor can only be ON characters (indices 0 to n-1)
  - Insert mode: cursor can be positioned AFTER last character (index n)
- Fixed all movement commands: l, $, G, j, k, h
- Added comments explaining the -1 adjustments as requested

#### 6. Mode-Aware Cursor Positioning (Major Enhancement) ✅

- **Added `editor_mode` to `PaneState`** - each pane now tracks its own mode
- Created `LineEndForAppend` movement direction for 'A' command
- 'A' command now positions cursor AFTER last character for insertion
- Mode transitions automatically adjust cursor position
- Applied mode-aware constraints to all navigation commands

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Mode per Pane**: User correctly suggested making `editor_mode` a property of `PaneState` rather than global, as panes could technically have different modes.

2. **Cursor Position Philosophy**:
   - Normal/Visual modes: cursor is ON characters (like selecting)
   - Insert mode: cursor is BETWEEN characters (insertion point)
   - This matches standard Vim behavior

3. **Automatic Adjustments**: When switching from Insert to Normal mode, cursor automatically pulls back if beyond last character.

### Known Issues

- Ghost cursoring issue has returned and is "pretty heavy" - leaving for future fix
- User will reset session for Phase 4

### Commits Made

1. "fix: Match Vim normal mode cursor behavior at line end"
2. "feat: Implement mode-aware cursor positioning"
3. "fix: Apply mode-aware cursor constraints to j/k/h navigation"

### Next Phase

Moving to Phase 4 of the Clean I/O Abstraction refactoring (new session)

### Important Context for Next Session

- Phase 1 and 2 completed previously
- Phase 3 now complete with all ANSI codes extracted and mode-aware cursoring
- Ghost cursor issue exists but deferred
- Check GitHub issue #74 for Phase 4 requirements

✅ **Successfully resolved rendering issues and applied core fixes**

#### 1. Rendering Issue Resolution

- **Problem**: Black screen due to hardcoded `is_ci = true` in terminal renderer
- **Solution**: Reverted to issue #55 commit `daffbf0` which has working terminal rendering
- **Result**: Application now renders properly without CI-mode hacks

#### 2. Issue #62 Core Implementation  

- **Added**: `src/repl/geometry.rs` with Position and Dimensions structs
- **Updated**: `src/repl/mod.rs` to include geometry module
- **Status**: Foundation ready for tuple-to-struct migration
- **Builds**: ✅ Successfully compiles

#### 3. Issue #67 Fix Applied

- **Problem**: Dysfunctional `b` command due to character index calculation bug
- **Fixed**: `find_previous_word_boundary` function in `src/repl/models/display_cache.rs`
- **Improvement**: Better character boundary detection for multi-width characters
- **Status**: ✅ Code compiles, needs testing

#### 4. Critical Bug Fix: Cross-Line Word Navigation

- **Problem**: `b` command stopped at word boundary within display line instead of crossing to previous lines
- **Root Cause**: `find_previous_word_position` used `char_count()` instead of `display_width()` when moving to previous line
- **Impact**: Command would get stuck on wrapped lines with multibyte characters
- **Fixed**: Changed `current_col = prev_line_info.char_count()` to `current_col = prev_line_info.display_width()` in `src/repl/view_models/pane_state.rs:518`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and compiles

#### 5. Discovered: Broader Wrapped Word Navigation Issue

- **Problem**: Word navigation commands (`w`, `b`, `e`) don't handle wrapped words correctly
- **Root Cause**: Word boundary detection operates on individual display lines, doesn't understand logical word continuity
- **Example**: Word "criticality" wrapped as "cri" + "ticality" - `b` command stops at "ticality" instead of jumping to "cri"
- **Impact**: Affects all vim-style word navigation when working with long lines (JSON, code, etc.)
- **Status**: 🔍 Identified, needs dedicated GitHub issue and separate fix

### Current State - Rollback Complete ✅

- **Branch**: feature/clean-rollback-with-position-structs (based on issue #55)
- **App version**: 0.25.1  
- **Rendering**: ✅ Working (no black screen issues)
- **Core structures**: ✅ Position/Dimensions structs available
- **Basic navigation**: ✅ Working
- **Word navigation**: ⚠️  Partially working (has wrapped word issue)

### Rollback Summary

✅ **Successfully resolved the original issues**:

1. **Rendering fixed** - Reverted to issue #55 (working terminal rendering)
2. **Issue #62 core applied** - Position/Dimensions structs ready for migration
3. **Issue #67 partially fixed** - Cross-line movement improved but wrapped word issue discovered

### Next Steps / TODO

- Create GitHub issue for wrapped word navigation problem (`w`/`b`/`e` commands)
- Continue Issue #62 migration if desired (replace remaining tuples with structs)
- Address wrapped word navigation in separate focused effort

## 2025-08-05 Session Notes

### User Request Summary

- Multiple terminal display and cursor positioning issues after ICU word segmentation implementation
- Cursor not visible, wrong positioning, Tab key pane switching not working
- Page scrolling (Ctrl+F) cursor positioning problems

### Completed Work ✅

#### 1. Terminal Size Detection Fix

- **Problem**: Hardcoded terminal size (80x24) instead of detecting actual window size
- **Fix**: Replaced hardcoded values with `crossterm::terminal::size().unwrap_or((80, 24))`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 87, 100

#### 2. Cursor Visibility Fix  

- **Problem**: Cursor not displaying at all - always hidden
- **Root Cause**: `is_display_cursor_visible()` always returned `false` due to status bar display flag misuse
- **Fix**: Changed cursor rendering to show cursor in Normal/Insert/Visual modes, only hide in Command mode
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 608-616

#### 3. Cursor Shape by Mode

- **Problem**: Cursor always showing as I-beam regardless of editor mode
- **Fix**: Implemented mode-based cursor styles:
  - Normal/Visual: `BlinkingBlock`
  - Insert/Command: `BlinkingBar`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 642-648

#### 4. Cursor Position Offset Fix

- **Problem**: Cursor starting at column 1 (where line numbers are) instead of after line numbers
- **Fix**: Added line number width offset: `screen_col = display_cursor.col + line_num_width + 1`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 631, 624

#### 5. Tab Key Pane Switching Fix

- **Problem**: Tab key switched pane state but cursor didn't visually move to response pane
- **Root Cause**: Response pane cursor positioning didn't account for pane offset
- **Fix**: Added response pane offset calculation: `screen_row = display_cursor.row + response_start`
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 632-635

#### 6. Page Scrolling Cursor Bounds Fix

- **Problem**: During Ctrl+F scrolling, cursor positioned beyond terminal bounds (row 132+ on 40-row terminal)
- **Fix**: Added cursor bounds clamping to prevent positioning outside visible area
- **Files**: `src/repl/views/terminal_renderer.rs` lines 643-661

#### 7. Environment Variable Enhancement

- **Added**: `BLUELINE_SHOW_DISP_CURSOR_POS` to control status bar cursor position display
- **Files**: `src/repl/models/status_line.rs` line 72

### Outstanding Issues ❌

#### 1. Page Scrolling Logic (Primary Issue)

- **Problem**: Ctrl+F page scrolling doesn't move cursor through logical buffer properly
- **User Requirement**: Page scrolling should move cursor by character/byte count in logical buffer, not display lines
- **Current State**: Attempted to implement logical buffer-based scrolling but still not working correctly
- **Implementation Started**:
  - Added `next_character_position()` and `previous_character_position()` methods to `BufferContent`
  - Modified `scroll_vertically_by_page()` to use character-count based movement
  - **Files**: `src/repl/models/buffer_model.rs` lines 52-82, `src/repl/view_models/pane_state.rs` lines 331-433

### Next Actions Required

#### Immediate Priority

1. **Debug page scrolling implementation**:
   - Check debug logs for `scroll_vertically_by_page` to see if character movement logic is executing
   - Verify `chars_per_page` calculation is reasonable
   - Test if cursor position updates in status bar during Ctrl+F

2. **Multi-byte character boundary handling**:
   - Ensure cursor doesn't land in middle of multi-byte characters after page scrolling
   - May need additional boundary checking in character navigation methods

3. **Page scrolling refinement**:
   - Fine-tune `chars_per_page` calculation (current: `page_size * content_width`)
   - Consider user's original suggestion about byte-based calculations
   - Handle edge cases (beginning/end of buffer)

#### Testing Strategy

```bash
# Test with debug logging
BLUELINE_LOG_LEVEL=debug BLUELINE_LOG_FILE=debug.log BLUELINE_SHOW_DISP_CURSOR_POS=1 ./target/debug/blueline --verbose

# Check page scrolling logs specifically
grep "scroll_vertically_by_page" debug.log

# Monitor cursor position changes  
grep "render_cursor.*screen_pos" debug.log
```

### Architecture Status

#### ICU Word Segmentation ✅

- ICU integration working properly for Issue #67 (`b` command fix)
- Word boundary caching and multi-byte character support operational
- No regressions in word navigation functionality

#### Terminal Rendering Pipeline ✅

- Fixed all rendering macro issues (`execute_term!`, `safe_flush!`)
- Proper crossterm integration restored
- Cursor positioning calculations working for normal editing

#### Current Page Scrolling Approach

The implemented approach moves cursor character-by-character through the logical buffer:

```rust
// Calculate characters per page
let chars_per_page = (page_size * content_width).saturating_sub(content_width);

// Move cursor by character count
for _ in 0..chars_per_page {
    let next_pos = self.buffer.content().next_character_position(new_cursor);
    // ... handle movement
}
```

This should provide the buffer-level movement requested, but needs debugging to identify why it's not working as expected.
