# Session Notes

## 2025-08-04 Session Notes

### User Request Summary
- User reported rendering issues (black screen) and dysfunctional `b` command
- Requested to rollback to clean state and reapply fixes

### Completed Work
‚úÖ **Successfully resolved rendering issues and applied core fixes**

#### 1. Rendering Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Black screen due to hardcoded `is_ci = true` in terminal renderer
- **Solution**: Reverted to issue #55 commit `daffbf0` which has working terminal rendering
- **Result**: Application now renders properly without CI-mode hacks

#### 2. Issue #62 Core Implementation  
- **Added**: `src/repl/geometry.rs` with Position and Dimensions structs
- **Updated**: `src/repl/mod.rs` to include geometry module
- **Status**: Foundation ready for tuple-to-struct migration
- **Builds**: ‚úÖ Successfully compiles

#### 3. Issue #67 Fix Applied
- **Problem**: Dysfunctional `b` command due to character index calculation bug
- **Fixed**: `find_previous_word_boundary` function in `src/repl/models/display_cache.rs`
- **Improvement**: Better character boundary detection for multi-width characters
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Code compiles, needs testing

#### 4. Critical Bug Fix: Cross-Line Word Navigation
- **Problem**: `b` command stopped at word boundary within display line instead of crossing to previous lines
- **Root Cause**: `find_previous_word_position` used `char_count()` instead of `display_width()` when moving to previous line
- **Impact**: Command would get stuck on wrapped lines with multibyte characters
- **Fixed**: Changed `current_col = prev_line_info.char_count()` to `current_col = prev_line_info.display_width()` in `src/repl/view_models/pane_state.rs:518`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and compiles

#### 5. Discovered: Broader Wrapped Word Navigation Issue
- **Problem**: Word navigation commands (`w`, `b`, `e`) don't handle wrapped words correctly
- **Root Cause**: Word boundary detection operates on individual display lines, doesn't understand logical word continuity
- **Example**: Word "criticality" wrapped as "cri" + "ticality" - `b` command stops at "ticality" instead of jumping to "cri"
- **Impact**: Affects all vim-style word navigation when working with long lines (JSON, code, etc.)
- **Status**: üîç Identified, needs dedicated GitHub issue and separate fix

### Current State - Rollback Complete ‚úÖ
- **Branch**: feature/clean-rollback-with-position-structs (based on issue #55)
- **App version**: 0.25.1  
- **Rendering**: ‚úÖ Working (no black screen issues)
- **Core structures**: ‚úÖ Position/Dimensions structs available
- **Basic navigation**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Word navigation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Partially working (has wrapped word issue)

### Rollback Summary
‚úÖ **Successfully resolved the original issues**:
1. **Rendering fixed** - Reverted to issue #55 (working terminal rendering)
2. **Issue #62 core applied** - Position/Dimensions structs ready for migration
3. **Issue #67 partially fixed** - Cross-line movement improved but wrapped word issue discovered

### Next Steps / TODO
- Create GitHub issue for wrapped word navigation problem (`w`/`b`/`e` commands)
- Continue Issue #62 migration if desired (replace remaining tuples with structs)
- Address wrapped word navigation in separate focused effort
