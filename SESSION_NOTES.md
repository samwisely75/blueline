# Session Notes

## [2025-08-23] HTTP Request Debugging Session - DNS Fix Applied

### User Request Summary
- Fix completely broken HTTP execution in blueline application
- HTTP requests failing with vague error messages
- Need to preserve session state across requests

### What We Tried and Found

#### Problem Identified
1. **Initial Issue**: HttpService was using `take()` to move HttpClient ownership for async operations
   - This meant subsequent requests would fail with "client cannot find a profile"
   - User emphasized: "do not recreate the client... it'll hold some session specific info"

2. **Solution Applied**: Made HttpClient Clone in bluenote
   - Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to HttpClient struct
   - Modified HttpService to use clone instead of take
   - This allows sharing across async tasks while preserving session state

3. **DNS Resolution Issue Found and Fixed**
   - Error: "error sending request for url (https://satoshi-dev-01.es.us-centra1.gcp.cloud.es.io/_search)"
   - DNS lookup revealed hostname typo: `us-centra1` should be `us-central1` (missing 'l')
   - Fixed in `/Users/satoshi/.blueline/profile`
   - Verified correct hostname resolves to 35.193.143.25
   - curl test confirms connectivity works with corrected hostname

4. **Enhanced Error Reporting**
   - Improved error handling in bluenote/src/http.rs to show detailed connection failures
   - Added error type detection (connection, timeout, SSL/TLS, DNS, etc.)
   - Added full error chain display using std::error::Error source chain
   - Added helpful notes for common error types

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/satoshi/Sources/samwisely75/rust/bluenote/src/http.rs`
   - Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to HttpClient
   - Enhanced error reporting with detailed categorization
   - Added error source chain traversal

2. `/Users/satoshi/Sources/samwisely75/rust/blueline/src/repl/services/http.rs`
   - Fixed execute_async to use clone instead of take
   - Improved error message display with anyhow chain

3. `/Users/satoshi/.blueline/profile`
   - Fixed hostname typo: us-centra1 ‚Üí us-central1

### Next Steps
- HTTP requests should now work with the corrected hostname
- The improved error reporting will help diagnose any future connection issues

## [2025-08-23] HTTP Service Architecture Deep Dive

### User Request Summary
- Fix HTTP execution issues in blueline (client not configured, requests failing)
- Implement HttpExecuteCommand as example of new command pattern
- Goal: Slim down AppController by moving logic to services and commands

### What We Tried and Found

#### HTTP Request Execution Problems
1. **First request**: "HTTP request failed: Failed to execute HTTP request" 
2. **Second+ requests**: "HTTP client not configured"
3. **Root cause**: HttpService takes ownership of client with `take()` but never restores it
4. **HttpClient limitations**: Not Clone, not thread-safe, needs to maintain session state

#### Architecture Exploration
- HttpService needs to execute requests asynchronously without blocking UI
- HttpClient cannot be moved to async task (not Clone)
- Session state (cookies, auth) must be preserved across requests
- Profile switching should be supported while requests are in-flight
- Future requirement: parallel requests to same endpoint

### Decisions Made

#### Immediate Decision: Fix bluenote First
Rather than working around HttpClient limitations in blueline, we decided to fix the root issue in bluenote:

1. **Phase 1 (immediate)**: Make HttpClient Clone
   - reqwest::Client is already Clone and thread-safe internally
   - Just need to make Endpoint Clone and wrap in Arc if needed
   - This solves the immediate sharing problem

2. **Phase 2 (soon)**: Add async convenience methods to bluenote
   - `request_async()` that handles spawn internally
   - Optional callback support for progress updates

3. **Phase 3 (later)**: Move session management to bluenote
   - Session headers, cookies, auth tokens all in bluenote
   - HttpService becomes pure text-to-request parser

#### Architecture Vision
**HttpService should be a thin layer** that only:
- Parses text into HTTP request format
- Delegates execution to bluenote's HttpClient

**bluenote should handle**:
- Async execution patterns
- Session management
- Connection pooling (via reqwest)
- Thread-safe client sharing

### Temporary Changes
- HttpService currently broken (loses client after first request)
- Partial implementation of Arc<Mutex> approach (incomplete)
- Need to revert some band-aid fixes

### Next Steps / TODO
1. Make HttpClient Clone in bluenote (add derives, check Endpoint)
2. Update HttpService to use cloned client for async tasks
3. Remove unnecessary complexity from HttpService
4. Test multiple HTTP requests work correctly
5. Consider adding request cancellation support

## [2025-08-21] Model Consolidation and Phase 1 Completion

### User Request Summary
- Complete Phase 1 of unified Command architecture and close GH #197
- Move data model files to models/ directory for better organization
- Consolidate overlapping types (initially LogicalPosition vs Position, but later decided to keep separate)
- Fix compilation errors and maintain backward compatibility

### What We Accomplished

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Unified Command Pattern Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- Successfully implemented unified command system where commands contain both `is_relevant()` and `handle()` methods
- Created `UnifiedCommandRegistry` that processes events by checking each command sequentially  
- Integrated into main event loop with gradual migration strategy via `handle_key_event_with_unified_first()`
- YankSelectionCommand working perfectly in the application

#### ‚úÖ Model Organization Cleanup - COMPLETE
Successfully moved all data model files to `/src/repl/models/` directory:

1. **yank_buffer.rs** ‚Üí `models/yank_buffer.rs` (Fixed issue #180)
   - Moved YankBuffer, ClipboardYankBuffer, MemoryYankBuffer to models
   - Updated imports throughout codebase

2. **screen_buffer.rs** ‚Üí `models/screen_buffer.rs` 
   - Completed display infrastructure grouping
   - ScreenBuffer, BufferCell now properly in models

3. **geometry.rs** ‚Üí `models/geometry.rs`
   - Position, Dimensions types for display coordinates
   - Maintained original `row/col` field naming for compatibility

4. **selection.rs** ‚Üí `models/selection.rs`
   - Selection type for text selection operations
   - Uses LogicalPosition for text coordinates

5. **NEW: logical_position.rs** ‚Üí `models/logical_position.rs`
   - Created new file for LogicalPosition, LogicalRange types
   - Moved from events/types.rs to consolidate data models
   - Added backward compatibility re-exports in events/types.rs

#### ‚úÖ Import and Compilation Fixes - COMPLETE
- Updated all geometry imports throughout codebase: `use crate::repl::geometry::` ‚Üí `use crate::repl::models::geometry::`
- Updated models/mod.rs to export all new types
- Updated view_models/mod.rs and repl/mod.rs for new module structure
- All 467 tests passing successfully
- Clean compilation with no errors or warnings

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Kept LogicalPosition and Position separate** - User decided they are logically different (text coordinates vs display coordinates) and should coexist rather than be consolidated
2. **Maintained backward compatibility** - Re-exported LogicalPosition/LogicalRange from events/types.rs so existing imports continue to work
3. **Used patch version v0.45.2** - This was organizational refactoring, not a new feature

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Unified Command Pattern**: Commands are self-contained with `is_relevant()` check and `handle()` execution
- **Gradual Migration Strategy**: New system integrated alongside old system for feature-by-feature migration
- **Clean Model Organization**: All pure data structures now properly located in models/ directory
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing with LogicalPosition (line/column) for text and Position (row/col) for display

### Temporary Changes
None - all changes are permanent architectural improvements

### Version Information
- **Current Version**: v0.45.2
- **Git Tag**: v0.45.2
- **Commit**: "Consolidate data models into models/ directory"

### Next Steps / TODO
- **Phase 2**: Migrate more commands to unified system
  - Candidates: navigation commands, editing commands, mode commands
  - Use existing YankSelectionCommand as template
  - Continue gradual migration approach

### Architecture Status
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Unified Command Infrastructure - COMPLETE  
- üîÑ **Phase 2**: Migrate Business Logic to Commands - READY TO START
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3**: Merge PaneManager into ViewModel - PENDING
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Move Event Loop to ViewModel - PENDING  
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Decouple ViewRenderer - PENDING
- ‚è≥ **Phase 6**: Dual Event Loops with Ghost Cursor Fix - PENDING

### Notes for Next Session
- Start Phase 2 by selecting commands to migrate to unified system
- YankSelectionCommand is working perfectly as template
- Focus on simple commands first (cursor movement, basic text operations)  
- Use `handle_key_event_with_unified_first()` pattern for gradual migration
- All infrastructure is in place for rapid command migration

## 2025-08-21 Session - Architecture Refactoring Plan for Issue #178

### User Request Summary
- Analyzed GitHub Issue #178: "Refactor: Centralize control into ViewModel"
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan to eliminate layers and centralize business logic
- Designed Command Pattern architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Addressed ghost cursor and flickering issues with dual event loops

### What We Accomplished

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Architecture Analysis**
- Analyzed current AppController (1500+ lines) with excessive business logic
- Identified PaneManager as unnecessary delegation layer
- Found tight coupling between ViewRenderer and ViewModel

‚úÖ **Command Pattern Design**
- Designed self-contained Commands owning their business logic
- Created Service layer for shared functionality (SelectionService, YankService, HttpService)
- Separated semantic Model Events from display-specific Render Events

‚úÖ **Event-Driven Rendering Architecture**
- Designed dual event loops (input and render) for optimal performance
- Created atomic render transactions to eliminate ghost cursors
- Added double buffering with smart diffing for smooth updates

‚úÖ **Complete Implementation Plan**
- Created detailed 6-phase implementation plan
- Estimated 12-18 days total effort across 3 weeks
- Designed incremental approach with independent testing

‚úÖ **GitHub Issue Creation**
- Created 6 implementation issues (#197-#202) for parallel development
- Created meta coordination issue (#203) for tracking
- Each phase has clear tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria

### Architectural Decisions

**Command Pattern with Services**
```rust
trait Command {
    fn handle(&self, context: &mut CommandContext) -> Result<Vec<ModelEvent>>;
}
```
- Commands own business logic (not ViewModel)
- Services provide shared functionality
- Clean separation from rendering concerns

**Event Flow Design**
```
Input Events ‚Üí Commands ‚Üí Model Events ‚Üí Render Events ‚Üí ViewRenderer
```
- Model Events are semantic (what happened)
- Render Events are display-specific (how to show it)
- No coupling between ViewRenderer and ViewModel

**Ghost Cursor Solution**
```rust
struct RenderTransaction {
    hide_cursor: bool,
    operations: Vec<RenderOperation>,
    show_cursor_at: Option<Position>,
    flush: bool,
}
```
- Atomic rendering prevents ghost cursors
- Double buffering eliminates flickering
- Smart batching optimizes performance

### Files Created
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 6-phase implementation plan
- GitHub Issues #197-#203 - Implementation and coordination issues

### Success Metrics Defined
- AppController: 1500+ lines ‚Üí ~100 lines
- Commands: Self-contained 50-100 line units
- ViewModel: Pure state management (~400 lines)
- Zero ghost cursors and flickering
- <1ms input response, 60fps rendering

### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1 (#197): Command infrastructure and service layer
- Phases can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Meta issue (#203) provides coordination and progress tracking

## 2025-08-23 Session - Service Layer Implementation for Yank/Paste

### User Request Summary
- Complete TODOs in YankSelectionCommand from Phase 1
- Implement Service Layer (originally part of Phase 1 design)
- Fix Visual Block mode copy/paste functionality
- Maintain clipboard toggle functionality (`:set clipboard on/off`)

### What We Accomplished

‚úÖ **Service Layer Architecture Implementation**
- Created `/src/repl/services/` directory with modular service structure
- Implemented `YankService` wrapping YankBuffer trait implementations
- Updated Command pattern to use `ExecutionContext` with both ViewModel and Services
- Successfully fixed Visual Block mode copy/paste operations

#### Key Components Created:

1. **YankService** (`src/repl/services/yank.rs`)
   - Manages switching between memory and clipboard yank buffers
   - Preserves content when switching modes
   - Provides consistent API for yank/paste operations

2. **ExecutionContext** (`src/repl/view_models/commands/command.rs`)
   - Provides both ViewModel and Services to commands
   - Avoids circular dependencies in architecture

3. **Services Aggregator** (`src/repl/services/mod.rs`)
   - Central struct containing all services
   - Currently contains YankService
   - Extensible for future services

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Removed SelectionService** - User correctly identified it as unnecessary indirection
   - Selection operations remain in ViewModel (UI state management)
   - Services should only exist when they add real value

2. **Service Layer Principles Established**:
   - Services manage their own state and resources
   - Services provide complex business logic
   - Services abstract external resources
   - Avoid creating services that are just delegators

### Bug Fixes Completed

‚úÖ **Visual Block Copy Fix**
- `handle_yank_selection` was using old `view_model.yank_to_buffer_with_type()`
- Fixed to use `services.yank.yank()`

‚úÖ **Visual Block Paste Fix**
- `handle_paste_after` and `handle_paste_at_cursor` were using `view_model.get_yanked_entry()`
- Fixed to use `services.yank.paste()`

### Pull Request Created and Merged
- **PR #204**: Service layer implementation with yank/paste fixes
- Successfully merged into develop branch
- Post-merge workflow completed (branches cleaned up)

### Architecture Status After This Session
- Service Layer pattern successfully integrated into Phase 1 architecture
- Commands now have access to both ViewModel (UI state) and Services (business logic)
- Visual Block mode fully functional with proper yank/paste operations
- Clipboard toggle functionality preserved and working

## 2025-08-17 Session - Complete Visual Mode Features (Issue #147)

### User Request Summary
- User returned and asked to check open issues
- Identified Issue #147 was closed but 'gv' command and Unicode support were not implemented
- Implementing missing features from Phase 7 of visual mode implementation

### What We Accomplished

‚úÖ **Implemented 'gv' Command (Visual Selection Repeat)**
- **Branch**: `feature/complete-visual-mode-features`
- **Implementation**: Added full support for 'gv' command to restore last visual selection
- **Key Components**:
  - Added `RepeatVisualSelectionCommand` that responds to 'v' in GPrefix mode
  - Added tracking of last visual selection (start, end, mode) in PaneState
  - Saving selection state when exiting any visual mode
  - Restoring selection with proper cursor positioning on 'gv'
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - Added `last_visual_selection_start/end` and `last_visual_mode` fields to PaneState
  - Created `VisualSelectionRestoreResult` type alias to avoid clippy complexity warnings
  - Proper event flow: Command ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí PaneManager ‚Üí PaneState
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed issue where visual selections were not saved when cut/delete operations cleared them
  - Added `save_last_visual_selection_before_clear()` helper method
  - Now saves selection before clearing in delete operations (x, d commands)
- **Quality**: All 377 unit tests passing, pre-commit checks pass

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Command Layer**: 
   - `RepeatVisualSelectionCommand` in `src/repl/commands/mode.rs`
   - Registered in command registry with proper priority

2. **Event System**:
   - Added `RepeatVisualSelectionRequested` to `CommandEvent` enum
   - Proper event handling in `AppController::handle_repeat_visual_selection()`

3. **State Management**:
   - PaneState tracks last selection in three new fields
   - Selection saved automatically on visual mode exit
   - Restoration includes mode type and cursor position

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Used type alias to satisfy clippy type complexity requirements
   - Clean separation of concerns across layers

### What's Still Pending from Issue #147

‚ùå **Unicode/Multi-byte Character Support**
- Visual Block selection still uses raw column indices
- No special handling for double-width characters
- Would require display width calculations in selection logic

‚ùå **Comprehensive Testing**
- No integration tests for 'gv' command yet
- No Unicode character tests for visual modes

‚ùå **Documentation**
- COMMANDS.md not created/updated
- Visual mode documentation not present

### Flickering Issue Investigation and Fix

**Problem**: User reported flickering when switching to Insert mode for the first time after app startup
- Only happens on the very first Insert mode switch
- Tilde characters and status bar flash briefly
- Subsequent mode switches work cleanly without flickering

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- During `initialize()`, cursor was hidden to prepare for initial render
- First mode switch to Insert required both:
  1. Changing cursor style (block ‚Üí bar)
  2. Changing cursor visibility (hidden ‚Üí shown)
- The visibility state change was likely triggering additional rendering operations

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `terminal_renderer.rs` initialization to not hide cursor initially
- Let `render_cursor()` handle visibility consistently
- This ensures mode changes only modify cursor style, not visibility state
- Cursor is temporarily hidden during render operations then restored

**Technical Details**:
- Removed `self.render_stream.hide_cursor()?` from `initialize()` method
- `render_full()` and `render_pane()` temporarily hide cursor during operations
- `render_cursor()` always shows cursor (except in Command mode)
- This eliminates the need for visibility state changes on first mode switch

### Next Steps
- User should test if flickering is resolved with this fix
- Unicode support would require significant changes to use display widths
- Integration tests should be added for 'gv' command
- Consider creating COMMANDS.md documentation
