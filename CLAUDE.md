# Claude Code Instructions

PLEASE READ AND STRICTLY FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` AND `docs/DEV_WORKFLOW.md`.

Also, stop saying "You're absolutely right!" in every response. It sounds insincere because you repeated it all the time. Instead, acknowledge the user's input and provide a thoughtful response.
