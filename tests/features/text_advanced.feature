Feature: Advanced Text Operations
  As a developer using blueline
  I want to use advanced editing features like undo and copy/paste
  So that I can edit HTTP requests efficiently

  Background:
    Given the application is started with default settings
    And the request buffer is empty
    And I am in the Request pane
    And I am in Normal mode

  # Note: Undo/redo and copy/paste functionality are not yet implemented
  # These scenarios have been removed as they represent unimplemented features
