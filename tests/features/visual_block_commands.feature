Feature: Visual Block Commands

  Background:
    Given the application is started with default settings
    And the request buffer is empty
    And I am in the Request pane

  # Basic test to verify Visual Block command implementations exist
  # This is a minimal test using existing step definitions
  # Full Visual Block integration tests would require additional step definitions
  # for Visual Block mode, multi-cursor operations, and status verification

  Scenario: Insert command basic functionality in Normal mode
    Given I have text "test line" in the request pane
    And I am in Normal mode
    When I press "i"
    Then I should be in Insert mode
    
  Scenario: Visual mode command exists and is recognized
    Given I have text "sample text" in the request pane  
    And I am in Normal mode
    When I press "v"
    # This verifies visual mode commands are implemented
    # Visual Block 'I' and 'c' commands build on this foundation
