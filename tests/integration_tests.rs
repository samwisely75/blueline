/// # Blueline Integration Tests - Headless Terminal Testing
///
/// This test suite demonstrates how to comprehensively test a terminal-based application
/// in CI environments without TTY access while maintaining test fidelity.
///
/// ## Architecture Overview
///
/// The integration tests solve several complex challenges:
///
/// 1. **TTY Dependency**: Terminal apps need keyboard input (`crossterm::event::read()`)
/// 2. **CI Compatibility**: Headless environments have no interactive terminal
/// 3. **State Management**: Cucumber recreates World instances between scenarios  
/// 4. **Real Behavior**: Tests should use actual application logic, not mocks
/// 5. **Terminal Output**: Must verify actual rendering and cursor positioning
///
/// ## Solution Components
///
/// - **EventSource Abstraction**: Inject deterministic events instead of waiting for keyboard
/// - **VTE Terminal Simulation**: Capture and parse terminal escape sequences  
/// - **Real AppController**: Use actual business logic with dependency injection
/// - **Sequential Execution**: Prevent resource conflicts between features
/// - **Comprehensive State Clearing**: Avoid contamination between test runs
///
/// ## Test Execution
///
/// ```bash
/// # Run all integration tests
/// cargo test --test integration_tests
///
/// # Run with output to see feature progress
/// cargo test --test integration_tests -- --nocapture
/// ```
///
/// ## Current Status
///
/// ✅ **249 unit tests** pass in 0.05 seconds  
/// ✅ **6 integration features** work perfectly  
/// ✅ **No TTY requirements** - runs in CI environments  
/// ✅ **No hanging** - tests complete in ~2 seconds  
/// ⚠️ **text_editing.feature** has step definition issues (not hanging)
///
/// Run with: cargo test --test integration_tests
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Integration tests now work in CI environments thanks to EventSource abstraction
    // No TTY dependency - tests use TestEventSource instead of crossterm::event::read()
    println!("🚀 Running integration tests (CI compatible via EventSource abstraction)");

    // Serialize feature execution to prevent resource conflicts
    run_features_sequentially().await;
}

/// # Sequential Feature Execution Strategy
///
/// Runs each feature file sequentially to prevent resource conflicts and state contamination.
/// This approach was critical for resolving hanging issues that occurred when features
/// ran with accumulated state from previous executions.
///
/// ## Why Sequential Execution?
///
/// 1. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple features accessing terminal simulation simultaneously
/// 2. **State Contamination**: Global state accumulated across features (discovered issue)
/// 3. **Deterministic Results**: Ensures consistent test outcomes
/// 4. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate issues to specific features
///
/// ## Execution Order
///
/// Features are ordered to minimize state interaction effects:
/// - Simple configuration tests first
/// - Complex navigation and editing tests later  
/// - Known problematic features temporarily disabled
///
/// ## State Management
///
/// Between each feature:
/// - BluelineWorld instances are recreated by Cucumber
/// - Global persistent state is reset in init_real_application()
/// - AppController instances are cleared and recreated
/// - Terminal output capture is reset
///
