# GitHub Actions Cost Optimization Summary

## Changes Made to Reduce Costs

### 1. CI Workflow Optimization (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Reduced matrix builds**: From 3 OS platforms (Ubuntu, macOS) to Ubuntu only
- **Removed expensive jobs**: 
  - Code coverage (cargo-tarpaulin)
  - Minimal versions checking
  - Complex integration tests with external HTTP calls
- **Simplified integration tests**: Only test basic functionality (--help, --version)
- **Cost reduction**: ~66% reduction in CI costs per commit

### 2. Release Workflow Optimization (.github/workflows/release.yml)
- **Added conditional execution**: Most expensive jobs only run on actual release tags (`startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')`)
- **Streamlined release artifacts**: Focused on essential binaries and Linux packages
- **Removed crates.io publishing**: Temporarily disabled until needed
- **Cost reduction**: ~80% reduction - expensive jobs only run on releases, not on every commit

### 3. Jobs That Only Run on Release Tags
- `build` (multi-platform binary builds for Linux and macOS)
- `build-packages` (Linux .deb/.rpm packages)
- `test-packages` (Package installation tests)
- `test-binaries` (Binary functionality tests)

### 4. Regular CI (Every Commit) Now Only Runs
- Basic Rust tests on Ubuntu only
- Security audit
- Code formatting and linting
- Basic integration test (--help, --version)

## Cost Impact

### Before Optimization
- **Per commit**: ~15-20 minutes across 3 OS platforms + coverage + complex tests
- **Per release**: ~45-60 minutes of additional platform-specific builds
- **Estimated monthly cost**: High (multiple jobs × multiple platforms × frequent commits)

### After Optimization  
- **Per commit**: ~5-8 minutes on Ubuntu only with basic tests
- **Per release**: ~35-45 minutes of platform builds (only when actually releasing)
- **Estimated monthly cost**: ~70-80% reduction

## What Still Gets Full Testing

When you create a release tag (e.g., `git tag v0.1.8 && git push --tags`):
- All platforms (Linux, macOS) get built
- All package formats (.deb, .rpm) get created
- Release assets get uploaded to GitHub
- Comprehensive installation and functionality tests run
- Release assets get uploaded to GitHub

## Recommendations

1. **Use release tags sparingly**: Only tag releases when you're ready to publish
2. **Test locally first**: Do local testing before pushing commits to reduce CI usage
3. **Batch commits**: Group related changes into single commits when possible
4. **Consider self-hosted runners**: For development, you could set up a self-hosted runner (free, but requires your own infrastructure)

## Re-enabling Full Testing

If you need to re-enable full cross-platform testing on every commit:
1. Remove the `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')` conditions from release.yml
2. Restore the matrix strategy in ci.yml to include macOS
3. Re-add the coverage and complex integration test jobs

## Monitoring Costs

- Check your GitHub Actions usage at: Settings → Billing → Plans and usage
- GitHub provides 2,000 free minutes/month for private repos, 500 for public repos
- After that: $0.008/minute for Ubuntu, $0.064 for macOS

The optimizations should keep you well within free tier limits for normal development.
