/// Run screen refresh scenarios individually to avoid thread_local state interference
///
/// ## Why Individual Scenario Files?
///
/// Originally, all screen refresh scenarios were in a single `screen_refresh.feature` file.
/// However, this caused test failures due to thread_local storage interference:
///
/// **Problem**: The MockViewRenderer uses `thread_local` storage for test isolation.
/// When multiple BDD scenarios run sequentially in the same test execution, they share
/// the same thread_local storage, causing state to persist between scenarios.
///
/// **Symptoms**: Tests would fail with incorrect call counts:
/// - Expected 1 render_full call, got 4 (accumulated from previous scenarios)
/// - Expected 1 render_cursor_only call, got 0 (wrong scenario's calls)
///
/// **Root Cause**: Cucumber runs all scenarios in a feature file within the same thread,
/// so `thread_local!` storage persists across scenario boundaries even when we explicitly
/// reset it in step definitions.
///
/// **Solution**: Split each scenario into its own feature file. This ensures each scenario
/// runs in complete isolation with its own fresh MockViewRenderer instance, preventing
/// any state interference between test cases.
///
/// **Files Created**:
/// - `screen_refresh_startup.feature` - Tests initialize_terminal + render_full on startup
/// - `screen_refresh_keyevents.feature` - Tests render_cursor_only for key events  
/// - `screen_refresh_textchanges.feature` - Tests render_content_update for text changes
/// - `screen_refresh_modechanges.feature` - Tests render_full for mode transitions
/// - `screen_refresh_shutdown.feature` - Tests cleanup_terminal on shutdown
///
/// This architectural decision ensures reliable, deterministic test execution while
/// maintaining comprehensive coverage of all screen refresh tracking functionality.
