# Release automation temporarily suspended during migration from httpc to blueline
# TODO: Re-enable and update when REPL migration is complete
#
# This workflow was originally designed for httpc single-execution mode
# and needs to be updated for blueline REPL-only mode
#
# To re-enable: rename this file back to release.yml and update the workflow
# content to reflect the new blueline application structure

# Original release workflow content has been moved here temporarily
# ... (original content would be here when needed) ...
